# Smart City - Humidifier
Implement a solution applied to Smart City using the ESP32 and one or more sensors/actuators, in addition to the already presented Relay and DHT11 (the use of Relay and DHT11 is optional). This solution will have to use an Internet connection and communicate its data with a remote service (Thingspeak, Cayenne Mydevices, Telegram, or any other).

The idea was to build a small-scale humidifier, aimed at smaller and enclosed places like bars, restaurants, shopping malls, stores, etc., thereby maintaining acceptable conditions for staying.
